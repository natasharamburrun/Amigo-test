### Key requirements:
- Use an API to display a list of items on a page (used any API  through demonstration with GraphQL will be a bonus)
- Click on an item and go to basic item show page to display more information

#### Build:

I decided to build this website using TMDb The movies database API to retrieve items. This API documentation was straightforward and easy to follow.

I used LocalStorage to get, set and remove favourite items appending them into an array this meant I did not need a backend server to complete this exercise.

#### Wins:

My ability to complete this task without the support of the academy teachers I found Google very helpful and used tutorials to get the favourite route working.

#### Challenges:

Found using localStorage challenging at first but managed to work my way through this by using pseudocode to understand the steps reach a solution.
